                <p>To My Son,
                    I hope you know how much I love you so.
                    I might embarrass you from time to time
                    By giving lots of love and needless kisses,
                    But you need to know Mom loves you so.
                    Before you were born I didn't know
                    Just how much I would love you so,
                    But when I looked into your eyes for the first time,
                    I felt my heart grow and grow.
                    A Mother's love is hard to explain,
                    Not everyone will feel the same.
                    Now that you are getting older I felt the need to tell you
                    Just how much I love you so.
                    Time may pass day after day or year after year,
                    But the love I have for you grows
                    nearer and dearer to my heart each day and year.
                    To my son, I hope you know just how much I love you so.</p>

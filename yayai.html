                <p>You laugh with me,
                    When I am hearty and happy.
                    My dear yYou cry with me,
                    When it is the smallest and saddest thing.
                    
                    Thanks for being such a wonderful daughter that you are,
                    Always shine like the brightest star!
                    
                     She does everything without any reason,
                    She is just the same in every season.
                    She cares and does not make you feel,
                    She does everything for you with great zeal.
                    You do not have to tell her anything,
                    She is the sparkle of life, a very cute bling!</p>
